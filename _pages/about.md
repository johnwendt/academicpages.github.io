### My Research

My research explores the influence of disturbance and climate change on organisms, communities, and ecosystems. My ongoing dissertation work seeks to understand how large herbivores cause and respond to environmental change across spatial and temporal scales. To this end, my work incorporates methods and principles several fields including paleoecology, analytical chemistry, fire ecology, paleoecoinformatics, and biogeography. 

In order to improve our understanding of large herbivore responses to climate change, spatially and physiologically, I am developing quantitative models to simulate millennial-scale shifts in range dynamics and climate envelopes. Additionally, I am working on an analytical approach for reconstructing changes in past herbivore community composition and population patterns from fossil molecules found in lake sediment records. I am also developing new records of vegetation, fire, human use, and climate at key paleoecological sites in the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains.
